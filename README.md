This is a collection of my solutions to [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com) written in Rust.  Most problems were solved
well after the respective season was over, but I did them anyway in order to
gain experience in Rust and as general mental exercise.

The input files and answers are encrypted using
[git-crypt](https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/) so that others can't use
them to cheat, and also because the author of Advent of Code has asked people
not to make the input files public.  They are only kept here for use in
automated regression testing to ensure I don't break any solutions with some
later refactor.
