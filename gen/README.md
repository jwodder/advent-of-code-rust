This is a command for generating a package for a new Advent of Code solution
from a built-in template.  Run with:

    cargo gen <year> <problem>

where `<year>` is the four-digit year of the Advent of Code problem being
solved and `<problem>` is the problem's two-digit day followed by either `a`
(for part 1) or `b` (for part 2).
